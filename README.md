# Fake-News-Detection

In this we are using Political News Dataset and classifying them whether the news is real or fake.

Dataset - 

Algorithm Used - Passive Agressive Classifier

It is an Online Learning Algorithm, where a tuple of data is used only once and then discarded. The reason for choosing this algorithm is that when we have very large amount of data (Exp-in Tb), it is difficult to use the same instance again and again in multiple iteration as it is very computationally  expensive.
