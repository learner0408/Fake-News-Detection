# Fake-News-Detection
Dataset - In this we are using political dataset and classifying them whether the news is real or fake.\

Algorithm Used - Passive Agressive Classifier\

It is an Online Learning Algorithm, where a tuple of data is used only once and then discarded. The reason for choosing this algorithm is that when we have very large amount of data (exp-in Tb), it is difficult to use the same instance again and again in multiple iteration as it is very computationally  expensive.
