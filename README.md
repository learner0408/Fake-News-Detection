# Fake-News-Detection

In this we are using Political News Dataset and classifying them whether the news is real or fake.

Dataset - The shape of the Dataset is 7796Ã—4. It contains the following attributes:-
(i) Title 
(ii) Text
(iii) Fake/Real

Algorithms Used - Tf-Idf Vectorizer and Passive Agressive Classifier

##Tf-Idf(Term Frequency- Inverse Term Frequency) Vectorizer## - This is used to convert the text into vector of words. It reflects the importance of a word in the document.

##Passive Agressive Classifier## - It is an Online Learning Algorithm, where a tuple of data is used only once and then discarded. The reason for choosing this algorithm is that when we have very large amount of data (Exp-in Tb), it is difficult to use the same instance again and again in multiple iteration as it is very computationally  expensive.
